- pass some kind of secret to prevent snooping/injection on the puppet
  head socket
- pass some kind of success message on start to verify the puppet
  strings are all OK
- only mmap() on regular files during transmission, so piping into stdin
  could work
- add --partial support
- remove pathnames in psync to increase speed (FTS_CHDIR)
- respect rsync -h (human readable numbers)
- fork and do local sockets with no ssh for local-to-local mode
- -v verbose mode is broken
- default output should be total silence without --progress
- writes should be sequential on receiving end
